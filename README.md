# Battleship-Game_Python-Flask-React.JS-CSS

## 1. I made a simple battleship game to host locally.
## 2. The major game logic uses Python and javascript helps bring everything together.
## 3. Python communicates with Javascript via Flask. 
## 4. Javascript communicates with localhost via Axios.
## 5. Added radio chatter for ambience

### Looking to add more aesthetic features in free time (e.g., 2d models and sound effects).
