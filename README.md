# Battleship-Game_Python-Flask-React.JS-CSS

## 1. I made a simple battleship game to host locally.
## 2. The major game logic uses Python (see backend folder) and javascript (see src folder) helps bring everything together.
## 3. Python communicates with Javascript via Flask. 
## 4. Javascript communicates with localhost via Axios.
## 5. Added radio chatter for ambience

# Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

1. Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download and install them from https://nodejs.org/.
2. Python: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download and install it from https://www.python.org/.
3. Git: You should probably install Git. You can download and install it from https://git-scm.com/.

Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository:
    git clone https://github.com/RPYJCC2/Battleship-Game_Python-Flask-React.JS-CSS.git
    cd Battleship-Game_Python-Flask-React.JS-CSS

2. Set Up the Backend:
    - Navigate to the backend directory:
      cd Backend
    - Install flask Python package from requirements.txt:
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    - Run the Flask application:
      python app.py

3. Set Up the Frontend:
    - Open a new terminal window or tab.
    - Navigate to the frontend directory:
      cd ../frontend
    - Install the required Node.js packages including axios and react:
      npm install  
    - Start the React application:
      npm start


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
